I am a PhD candidate in the School of Geography and the Environment at the University of Oxford. I am interested in exploring the resilience and environmental impacts of global food systems. My research involves mapping food flow networks at subnational scales using predictive modelling, projecting future food flow networks under socio-economic pathways and dietary change scenarios, and estimating the environmental impacts of food supply chains. I am based in the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment cluster, and my research is supervised by Professor Sam Fankhauser and Dr Radhika Khosla. 

I also work as a consultant with the World Bank's Living Standards Measurement Study Team on the 50x2030 Initiative to close the agricultural data gap. Prior to my DPhil, I worked as Lead Agricultural Data Scientist at Atlas AI, a silicon-valley startup founded by Stanford University Professors David Lobell, Marshall Burke, and Stefano Ermon. I obtained a Masters in Public Policy from University of California, Berkeley, and a Bachelors in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee.
